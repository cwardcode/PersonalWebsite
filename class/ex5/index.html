<p>
Remember, slope conditions change as the result of weather, skier traffic and other factors. Be aware of changing conditions! 
</p>

<div>
<p>
Our lift equipment requires routine maintenance. Although every precaution is taken; in rare cases, grease may drip from lift equipment. Sugar Mountain Resort is not responsible for grease on clothing or equipment. This is an inherent risk of the sport.
